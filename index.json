Batch processing typically consists of two separate steps: 1) Batch loading images onto a web server, and 2) Mapping image URLs to specimen records residing within the Symbiota portal. Technically, images are not stored within a Symbiota database. Instead, the URLs of the images are mapped to specimen records. Contact the portal manager to inquire about the workflow details supported by a given portal.\nImages uploaded or linked to specimens in a Symbiota portal should be JPGs or in another web-friendly format. It is recommended that individual files are no larger than 8 MB to allow users with slower connectivity to view them within a reasonable timeframe.\n Common Workflows   Image Drop Folder: Using a mapped network drive, FTP, SFTP, Dropbox, or other cloud storage, a drop folder is made available so that the imaging team can regularly deposit new images. This folder is referred to as the \u0026ldquo;source folder\u0026rdquo;. Once images are uploaded to the source folder, you can use the Processing Toolbox to create web-ready derivatives and move the images to a local server. The derivatives are then mapped to specimen records through image URLs.\n  Local Storage: If images are stored on a local server that is write-accessible to the portal code, image processing can be performed directly through the portal interface. Image URLs stored locally can be mapped into the database using relative links without the domain name. In this case, the the web server user (e.g. Apache user) must have write access to both the source and target folders.\n  Remote Image Storage: Images can also be processed and stored on a remote server and mapped to the specimen image through the full image URL. Standalone image processing scripts will be needed to process images and map image URLs to the portal database. Scripts can be configured to write the image URL directly to the database or image metadata can be written to a log file, which is loaded into the database afterwards. Remote images must be mapped into the database using the full image URL with the domain name.\n If only a large image is made available from the remote server, the image URL can be mapped to the urloriginal field, and then portal will then create local web and thumbnail dirivatives. If the images are named using the catalog number, and the web server is configured to display directory contents, the Processing Toolbox within the collection\u0026rsquo;s management menu contains a method to harvest image links from the directory listing. Alternatively, one can perform a \u0026ldquo;skeletal record import\u0026rdquo; that contains a column with the catalogNumber and another associatedMedia column with the image URL.    CyVerse Image Storage: This method requires an agreement of a collection with CyVerse. CyVerse can store images as Community Data files and use BisQue to create web-accessible URLs for these files. You can then use the Processing Toolbox to map CyVerse URLs to specimen records in your portal.\n  ","tags":["images"],"section":"coll_manager"},{"date":"1639440000","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/images/batch/","title":"Batch Uploading Images","summary":"This page describes some workflows for batch uploading images into a Symbiota portal.\n Symbiota portals do not necessarily store images, rather, they store links to where images can be accessed via the web.

Any storage solution that can provide a web-accessible URL to an image can be used to link images to occurrences in a Symbiota portal.\nImage Storage at ASU For relatively small collections with little to no IT support, the Arizona State University may be able to web-host the jpeg versions of images for display in a Symbiota portal. In this case, images are uploaded to ASU via Dropbox and transferred to ASU servers. The URLs generated by these servers are then linked to your records in a Sybmiota portal. To determine whether this is possible for your collection, contact the Symbiota Support Hub.\nImage Storage through CyVerse Some research and digitization networks have agreements with CyVerse in which CyVerse creates web-accessible URLs to images that are uploaded to their servers, and the Symbiota portal harvests these URLs and links them to occurrences in a Symbiota portal. Some example documentation is shown below. Contact CyVerse for more information about this option.\n California Phenology Network image upload through CyVerse SERNEC image upload through Cyverse  Image Storage through an Institutional Server If your institution has the ability to serve images in a web-accessible format, these URLs can be easily linked to their occurrences in your portal through a batch processing script.

Log in to your account and navigate to your Data Editor Control Panel (My Profile \u0026gt; Occurrence Management \u0026gt; name of collection). Click Edit Existing Occurrence Records. Place a barcode on your specimen. Look for a stamped number (“accession number”) on the specimen.  If a stamped number does not exist, proceed to step 8.   In the Record Search Form, enter the stamped number into the Other Catalog Numbers field. Do not include leading zeros (e.g., if the stamp is 01499, enter 1499). Click Display Editor.  If no record is returned, double check that you entered the accession number correctly into the Other Catalog Numbers field and that there are no extra spaces before or after the numbers you typed. If the number is correct, contact a supervisor. If a record is returned, check that the data on the specimen record match the data on the label of the specimen in front of you, particularly collector, collector number, and date. i. If these data match, place your cursor in the Catalog Number field (top left) and scan the barcode of the specimen in front of you. The barcode number will then appear in this field. Press Tab on your keyboard, followed by Enter. Proceed with imaging the specimen and return to step 1. ii. If these data do NOT match, contact a supervisor.    To re-open the Record Search Form after you have performed a search, click the magnifying glass icon at the top right side of the specimen record.\n In the Record Search Form, enter the last name of the collector preceded by a percent sign (%), the collector number, and the date (in YYYY-MM-DD format) into the top three fields (see example below) and click Display Editor.  If no record is returned, double check that you entered data correctly into the appropriate fields. If everything looks correct, contact a supervisor.

Option 2: View new images in the portal and link by manually entering the accession number This protocol describes how to update your old accession number with the specimen’s new barcode number. You can do this only after you have uploaded specimen images into your portal through a batch process that has created new \u0026ldquo;unprocessed\u0026rdquo; records consisting of only a barcode number and an image.\n (Example instructions for an herbarium collection)\n Log in to your account and navigate to your Data Editor Control Panel (My Profile \u0026gt; Occurrence Management \u0026gt; name of collection). Click Edit Existing Occurrence Records. In the Record Search Form, click the Processing Status field and select “Unprocessed” from the dropdown menu. In the Custom Field 1 field, select Other Catalog Number from the first dropdown menu and IS NULL from the second dropdown menu. Click the “Display Editor” button. Locate the accession number (the stamped number, rather than the barcoded number or the collector number) on the specimen in the image to the right of the Occurrence Editor form.  You can zoom in by pressing Command (Mac) or Control (Windows) and clicking on the image where you want to zoom in. Alternatively, you can hold Shift, click on the area where you want to zoom in, and move the mouse up (to zoom in) or down (to zoom out).   Enter the accession number, without leading zeros (e.g., if the number reads “0145”, you will enter “145”), into the Other Cat. #s field (circled in screenshot below).  Click outside of the Other Cat. #s field (or press the Tab button). A message should show up under the “Dupes?” button. Make sure that your browser’s pop-up blocker is disabled so you can see these messages.  If the message shows “No Dupes Found”:  Check that the specimen sheet is not stamped “Databased” or has any other indication that it SHOULD have a record in the database. If it is, try adding a leading zero to the accession number and repeat step 9. Press the Save Edits button (or press Tab and Enter on your keyboard) Move on to step 9.   If a pop-up window shows up that says “Record(s) using the same identifier already exists. Do you want to view this record?”:  Click OK. Check that the identified duplicate does not already have an image associated with it (if it does, you will see a bold barcode number on that record). If the duplicate does have an image already, close the window, scroll down to the Processing status field in the Curation box, select “Expert Required” from the dropdown menu, and then click the Save Edits button. Otherwise, move to step c. Check that the data of the identified duplicate matches the data on the label of the specimen image you were viewing. You need not check every field, just two or three important fields such as Scientific Name, Collector, and Locality. If the data match up, click “Merge Records” and exit the duplicate window. If the data do not match up, close the window, scroll down to the Processing status field in the Curation box, select “Expert Required” from the dropdown menu, and then click the Save Edits button.

Portal contacts are typically listed on the homepage or within the left menu of the data portal. Contact symbiota@asu.edu for help if you are unable to find the portal contact.\nYou may publish data to more than one portal; however, it is recommended to only manage a particular dataset or collection in one Symbiota portal, and all other portals would host only a snapshot of those data. Different collections (e.g., vascular plants vs. lichens vs. bryophytes) can be live-managed on their respective portals.\nTypically, the portal manager will need the information in the following list to initiate your collection within the portal. Once the collection has been added, data can be loaded. See the page on Uploading Specimen Data for details on methods and acceptable data formats for upload specimen.\nInformation needed to create a new collection within a portal:\n Collection title that will be listed on the search page Institution and collection codes (e.g. acronyms) Short description of collection holdings and preparation types Contact(s): name, title, email, and ORCID, if available Link(s) to homepage and/or other external resources Collection or institution icon – a small image that visually represents the collection, icons that are roughly the same height and width work best Preferred usage rights. The portal manager should be able to advice you on this. It may also be useful to read the following Creative Commons links: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/, http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Data Whether you are publishing a snapshot of your data that will be periodically updated, or you plan to manage the data as a live dataset directly within the portal Source of the Global Unique identifier (GUID) for the specimen records. If the specimen records are managed directly within the portal, we recommend letting the portal automatically generate a GUID (UUID) when records are created. If a data snapshot is published from a local in-house data management system, GUIDs need to be generated locally and then included in the data published to the portal.  What if I have multiple collections or data types? If you have multiple collections (e.g., vascular plants, fungi, and bryophytes), it is recommnded to manage these separately in their respective data portals. This is because the taxonomic thesauri of the portals are well-curated to their focal taxonomic group, and you are more likely to be able to take advantage of digitization efficiencies (e.g., duplicate matching) in that portal.

However, a copy of their bryophyte and lichen data can be found in the CCH2 portal as well, since it is a resouce for the California community.\nWhat if I want to have the same collection in more than one portal? No problem! In some cases, multiple portals may benefit from including some or all of your collection\u0026rsquo;s data.

They are meant to aid in locating and fixing taxonomic errors and inconsistencies.\nAnalyze Taxonomic Names   This function analyzes the values that exist in the Scientific Name field in your database and flags the values that are not linked to the taxonomic thesaurus (i.e., are not linked to a recognized name). Note that this tool does NOT evaluate whether that name is accepted according to current taxonomy. The number of unrecognized scientific names is listed at the top of the Action Menu box.\nYou can evaluate the unrecognized scientific names and link them to the names of the correct taxa by clicking the name of the Taxonomic Resource to which you want to compare the names, selecting the target kingdom, and clicking the Analyze Taxonomic Names button. If you wish to begin at a certain name (e.g., you have already checked names up to Mentzelia), you can enter this name in the Start Index field. You can also alter the number of names you would like the portal to analyze per run in the Names Processed per Run field. There are multiple types of results from running this tool. In general, the tool will list the name that it is attempting to index (i.e., match to an existing taxonomic name), search your defined taxonomic resource for that name, and, if that name is not found in the taxonomic resource, check the taxonomic thesaurus for similar names to the unrecognized name. You then have several options for resolving the unrecognized name, depending on the type of result. To view the specimen(s) associated with any unrecognized name, click the pencil icon to the right of the name and number of specimens, in brackets. The types of results are explained in more detail below.\nExample 1: Misspelling, incomplete name, or orthographic variant This is the most common type of result. In this case, you discover that the unrecognized name was misspelled or spelled differently than the recognized name. You can click “remap to this taxon” to change the name of the specimen(s) to this recognized name.\nExample 2: Unpublished or unrecognized taxon name In this case, you find that the name listed on the specimen was not published or is not currently listed in the taxonomic thesaurus. You must then use taxonomic expertise to decide whether this specimen should be remapped to a different taxonomic name (if you are confident that they are synonymous) and/or annotated, or if the taxonomic name should be left as is and it should be included in the taxonomic thesaurus. If you believe that a name should be found in the taxonomic thesaurus and you do not find it with a manual search, contact the portal manager.\nExample 3: Name exists but is not found in taxonomic thesaurus When the portal does not find a name in the taxonomic thesaurus, but it does find the name in the taxonomic resource, it will import the taxonomic name into the taxonomic thesaurus. This will automatically map the specimen’s taxonomic name to this newly added entry in the taxonomic thesaurus as well.\nIf you have not analyzed all the taxonomic names in one pass, you can click the Continue Analyzing Names button to have Symbiota check the next 20 (or whatever number is defined by the user) names.\nTaxonomic Distributions Much like the Geographic Distribution viewer, the Taxonomic Distribution viewer can be used to examine the families, genera, species, and infraspecific taxa that exist in your database. Misspellings, non-standardized entries, or suspected mistakes can be detected using this tool. To view the genera for each family, click the name of the family. Then, to view the species for each genus, click the name of the genus, and so on.

To ensure images are in the correct orientation in a Symbiota portal, you must ensure that the image has been rotated using a program that actually rotates the image data rather than just adding a EXIF metadata orientation tag (which is how most cameras and file explorers rotate images).\nAdjusting the camera settings to define the correct orientation, or batch rotating the images within file explorer on a PC are not ideal because they only modify the EXIF metadata orientation tag within the file and do NOT actually rotate the image file (pixel data). While many software programs (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, MS Windows Explorer, etc) will auto-rotate correctly based on the orientation tag and display the image correctly, not all software programs will do this (e.g. Internet Explorer, some browser plugins, etc). Furthermore, when images are upload on the web, the orientation tags are often not carried over to web derivatives generated by the file upload program (e.g. thumbnail, web views, etc). For example, the image links below will all have the wrong orientation when viewed in Internet Explorer (PC version), and only the full size (original) image will self-orient within Chrome or Firefox.\nThumbnail\nWeb View\nFull Size\nThe safest solution is to rotate the actually image data (pixel definition) rather than just the setting the orientation tag. This can be done as a batch processing using image editing programs such as Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop. The link below provides a list of a number of free options for lossless rotation of images.

This will bring up a panel on the lower right side of the screen. Add the name of a taxon you wish to add. Do NOT include the authorship of the taxon. You can start typing, and a dropdown list will allow you to select the taxon from available options.  You cannot add a name that is not present in the taxonomic thesaurus (it will tell you if this is the case). If you find that the taxon you wish to add is not present:  Check that your spelling is correct. Use a vetted taxonomic resources, such as Tropicos or IPNI to check. If your spelling is correct, contact your portal manager with the name, authorship, and a reference or link to that name in another taxonomic database, and it will be added for you.     Fill in the other fields if desired. All of these fields can be left blank:  Family Override: If you enter the family name here, you will override the family provided by the taxonomic thesaurus. It is advised not to enter anything in this field. Habitat: If the taxon is usually found in a particular habitat in the area circumscribed by the checklist, you can include this information here. Abundance: Here you can note how frequently/abundantly this taxon is found in the area circumscribed by the checklist. For example, you can use terms like “common,” “frequent,” or “rare.” Notes: Any other comments about this taxon pertaining to your checklist area can be put here, for example: “Cultivated ornamental” or “favored by honeybees” Internal notes: This field, unlike the others, will be visible only to people authorized to edit the checklist. You might make a note “need to check the species” or “no picture available” for example. Source: This field is more likely to be used for research and teaching checklists. For such checklists, it is useful to know whether the information came from a flora, some other publication, or a report by some   Click the “Add species to List” button.  Batch Adding Taxa   If you have several taxa to add at one time, you can upload them in a CSV (comma separated value) file. The easiest way to create the desired listing is to use Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc and then save the file as a CSV file. In your CSV file, one column in the file should be labeled sciname. This should contain the scientific name of the taxon WITHOUT the authorship included. In this CSV file, you must be very careful to spell the scientific names correctly. If you have an error in your spelling, you will not be able to load that name into your checklist. You can also include “family”, “habitat”, “abundance”, and “notes” columns (see above for descriptions of these fields) in this file.

Users with Taxon Profile editing permissions can submit an image by clicking on the editing symbol located in the upper right of any Taxon Profile page, or through the image submission links available on the sitemap page. Field images with specific locality details (e.g. coordinates) can be loaded as Image Vouchers (see below).  Image Vouchers (field images with location information) Field images with specific locality information can serve as vouchers for field observations of many birds, mammals, and easy-to-identify plants. There are, however, some taxonomic groups that typically require microscopic or chemical analysis for accurate identification (e.g. lichens, bryophytes, fungi). For such organisms, field images will have limited value. For this reason, some data portals might not allow the submission of observations without a physical specimen.\nIt is particularly important that images intended as vouchers for an observation be of high quality and clearly display diagnostic morphology of the organism. Data fields required for an image to qualify as a voucher include: observer name, observation date, country, state, locality description, latitude, longitude, and at least one image.\nAs is the case with images of physical specimen, Image Vouchers are displayed on both the Occurrence Details and the Taxon Profile pages.

Click the pencil icon that has a V next to it (the center icon in the top right corner of the page, circled below).  If this is the first time you have used this tool, you will be asked to first define the search statement (i.e., search parameters) that will be used to find the specimens that might pertain to your checklist. You can use a variety of fields to define your search, as described below.  You will be able to change the search statement in the future, so you are not necessarily defining the bounds forever.\n  You can enter search terms for a number of fields on the left side of the form. You can use the polygon footprint that you defined when creating the checklist (see 29:1 Creating a checklist, step 3c) to search for specimen records by checking the “Search based on polygon defining checklist research boundaries” box. If you did not define a polygon previously, you can also do so from here by clicking the pencil icon to the right of this option and following the steps outlined in 29:1 Creating a checklist, step 3c. You can define a specific bounding box by entering the latitude and longitude values that delimit the box, or by defining the lat/long values on a map. To do the latter:  Click the globe icon to the right of the Lat North field In the pop-up window, pan and zoom to the location where you want to place the bounding box. Click on the approximate center where you want the bounding box to be located. Adjust the location and size of the bounding box as desired by clicking and dragging inside the box (to move the box) or clicking and dragging one of the circles on the sides or corners of the box (to resize the box). To save the bounding box, click Save and Close.     There are a number of important checkboxes below the Lat/Long fields that you can use to refine your search. For example, you can allow the search to return specimens with the desired search terms OR within certain latitude and longitude coordinates. You can use any combination of the above options to search for voucher specimens.  Once you have entered the desired search terms, click the Save Search Terms button.

Note that the name you enter in this box must already be found in the list of taxa in your checklist. Click the Link Voucher button.      Adding Individual Specimens from Your Own Collection You must be an editor of a collection to assign specimens in this way.\n  Look up a specific specimen in your own collection (e.g., by clicking Edit Existing Occurrence Records in your Data Editor Control Panel and searching by a specific catalog number or by using other search terms). On the resulting page, click the Linked Resources tab. In the Checklist Voucher Linkages box (see below), select the desired Checklist from the dropdown menu and click Link to Checklist as Voucher. A new window will likely pop up as a result, but you can ignore this window and close the editor. The specimen has been successfully linked as a voucher to the desired checklist.

Alternatively, you can another list type from the Checklist Type dropdown menu. A Species Exclusion List is used to curate a subset of taxa that are purposely excluded from another list, and a Rare, threatened, protected species list is used to compile a state-level list of rare, threatened, and protected taxa for which locality data will be redacted for specimens in that state. To indicate that this checklist is a subset within a larger checklist, select the “parent” (larger) checklist from the More Inclusive Reference Checklist dropdown menu. You can define the area included in the checklist by describing it in the Locality and Abstract fields, including Latitude and Longitude coordinates, and/or you can define the boundaries of that area geographically by setting a “footprint polygon”. To define a “footprint polygon”:  Click the globe icon inside the Polygon Footprint box. A Google map will appear a new window. Drag the map until it shows the region covered by your checklist, then zoom in until you can see the boundaries of the area. Click the polygon icon in the top center of the window then click around the boundaries of your area. When you get back to the point where you started, double click the starting point. This will lock the coordinates into the text box at the bottom of the window. Your defined area will shaded in.

In the Data Editor Control Panel, click “Batch Georeference Specimens.” Enter your desired search terms in the provided Query Form box. You can search by Country, State, County, Municiplaity, Processing Status, and/or Locality Terms. Then click Generate List.  Select the entry that you want to work on and click the Geolocate icon at the top right of the search results. This will open a new GeoLocate window (see next screenshot) displaying a map and, in some cases, possible location(s) for the specimen that GeoLocate inferred from the text.  The green dot is GeoLocate’s best guess for the locality of the specimen. You may also see red dots, which are alternative guesses. To view the reasons why GeoLocate selected these dots, click the “# possible locations found” tab to the right of the Workbench tab. The words in all caps are those that GeoLocate used to infer a location.    Click the “Options” button on the bottom left of the GeoLocate window and ensure the “Do Uncertainty” box is checked. Close the Georeferencing options window. Make sure that all of the boxes (latitude, longitude, uncertainty, and error polygon) near the bottom right of the window are checked. If there are dots on the map, investigate whether any of them could be a good starting point for your georeferencing by comparing the dots’ locations on the map to the text in the Locality String (see dashed box in screenshot above). It is possible that none of the dots indicate the correct locality. If this is the case, you can ignore the dots or remove them by clicking the “# possible locations found” tab and clicking the circled ‘x’ to the left of each rejected entry (see below).  When deciding whether to use one of the GeoLocate dots, make sure to check that the state and county where the dot has been placed matches the state and county indicated by the record.    Either starting with a GeoLocate dot, if appropriate, or from scratch, use the Locality String to determine an approximate location for the specimen. This will likely require searching other references (e.g., Google maps) for location and feature names.  You can change the base layer (i.e., the type of map shown in the GeoLocate window) by clicking the plus symbol in the upper right corner of the window (see next screenshot). To measure a distance on the map, click the button next to “Measure” and click on a starting point on the map. You can then move your cursor anywhere on the map and a line will be measured between those two points. The length of the line will be shown in green next to the line. To measure between more than one point, click again to anchor another point. To stop measuring, double click on the ending point of your measurement. If there is not enough information in the Locality String to assign an approximate point, view the specimen record by returning to the search results page (see screenshot below) and clicking the pencil icon on the top right of the search results box. This will bring up the specimen record, where you can see whether there is more locality information in another data field (e.g., habitat) or on the specimen image (if available).  If you are still not able to assign an approximate point from this information, scroll down to the bottom of the specimen record until you see the Processing Status field. Select “Expert Required” from the dropdown menu of this field. In the “Notes (Occurrence Remarks)” field above and to the left, enter a brief note in brackets, such as “[Not enough data to georeference]”. Click the “Save Edits” button, close the record, and select a new record to georeference.       Once you have found an approximate location for the specimen record, click the button next to “Place Marker” and click on the map where you want to place the GeoLocate dot. We recommend using the Georeferencing Quick Guide to determine where to place the point.\n  Set the error radius and/or create an error polygon to indicate the uncertainty of the specimen’s locality. We recommend using the Georeferencing Quick Guide to determine how large of an error radius to use for a given point and whether you should use an error polygon.\n To edit the size of the error radius, click the green dot on the map and select “Edit Uncertainty” in the pop-up box. Click and drag the grey arrowhead that will appear on the outer rim of the error circle to resize the error radius. To create an error polygon, click the button next to “Create polygon” and click on the map where you want to begin drawing the polygon. A corner of the polygon will be created time you click on the map. To finish the polygon, double click. Once you have completed the polygon, click the green dot again and select “Resize uncertainty to polygon.”  To redo a polygon, click the “Clear Polygon” button to the right of the “Options” button.   Make sure to note any uncertainty you experienced when setting the error radius. For example, if you were georeferencing a named place that did not have clear boundaries, explain how you determined a suitable error radius by putting a note in the Remarks field on the search results page where you first selected your specimen record.    When you are confident in your GeoLocate point and error radius, click the “Save To Your Application” button at the bottom of the GeoLocate window. You will be taken back to the search results page where you first selected your specimen record (see first screenshot).  The coordinates and error will now show up below the search results in the appropriate Latitude, Longitude, and Error fields. If you created an error polygon, its coordinates will be listed in the Footprint WKT field.   Click the “Update Coordinates” button at the bottom of the page.

Name Game Summary \u0026ldquo;Name Game\u0026rdquo; is a memory recall game that prompts users to guess (and spell) a genus and species included in a checklist.\nHow to play  Begin by guessing a letter that you believe might occur in the genus or species epithet. Every time you incorrectly guess a letter, your remaining number of chances (3-12) will decrease. The :rose: :sunflower: :apple: icons simply visualize your progress and remaining number of changes (i.e., the rose withers, the apple is consumed, and the flower petals are removed with diminishing chances). Hints: Selecting a hint will cost you one chance, and they cannot be used on your last guess. On the keypad, select the ? (wildcard) button to fill in one letter for you; the Show Family button will display the species' family. If you correctly guess the genus and species before your chances run out (0), your number of games won will increase. If you do not correctly guess the species, select Reveal the Answer to display the answer. In either case, a link will then appear to the taxon record for further study. New Game will prompt the next question. Your number of games played, won, and success rate will be tracked as you continue playing and initiate new games.  Other tips  Your selected difficulty level affects how many chances you get: 3 (hardest), 6, or 12 (easiest). Spaces are already displayed for you. You do not have to guess them. You cannot change the difficulty level mid-game.  Flash Card Quiz Summary \u0026ldquo;Flash Card Quiz\u0026rdquo; prompts users to identify species from a checklist using images.\nHow to play  Choose the species displayed in the image from the Name of Organism dropdown menu. Up to 5 images of the mystery species will be recalled. You can limit the images to a certain family by additionally using the Filter Quiz by Taxonomic Group dropdown menu. If you identify the species correctly, a message will alert you to this success, and one point will tally below the image. Additionally, if you identify the species correctly on your first guess, that success will also be tracked below the image. If you cannot identify a specimen, select Tell Me What It Is! and the taxon record will display for further study. Selecting Display Common Names will add common names to the species list that displays in the Name of Above Organism dropdown menu. Reset Game will reset your score to zero.  Other tips  If the images are not displaying, try using a different browser. The quiz will bring up the first image associated with the taxon record, up to a maximum of five images. The sort order of these images can be edited on the taxon record to display in a different order (see \u0026ldquo;Game administration\u0026rdquo; below).  Game administration Checklists The species displayed in each game are dependent on the contents of the selected checklist. Editing a checklist requires a portal login and possibly additional permissions depending on who created (owns) the list. You can add/remove taxa that display in games by editing checklists, if your account has permission to do so.\nImages If your account has Taxon Profile Editor permissions, you can edit which images display in the flash card quiz by changing the sort order of images in the Taxon Profile Editor, such that the images with a value of \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; will appear first, \u0026ldquo;2\u0026rdquo; second, and so on. The default sort value is \u0026ldquo;50\u0026rdquo;.

Endorsement essentially establishes your organization as an entity (a \u0026ldquo;publisher\u0026rdquo;) within GBIF\u0026rsquo;s data portal, thereby enabling GBIF to index your collections dataset as a contribution from your home university, museum, etc. This process is typically straightforward, as described below.\n         Sample GBIF publisher page for the ASU Biocollections     Determine whether your organization is already endorsed:   Go to GBIF\u0026rsquo;s Become A Publisher page and scroll to the bottom of the page. Thoroughly search for your institution. For example, simply searching on \u0026ldquo;ASU\u0026rdquo; will not bring up \u0026ldquo;Arizona State University\u0026rdquo;, so try all possible combinations before concluding your organization is not registered. You can also search the GBIF portal for all endorsed publishers here. ⚠️ If your organization is found in the search form, do not request endorsement. Instead, look for the contacts listed under your institution\u0026rsquo;s publisher page and reach out to them for assistance before proceeding with publishing your dataset. If your organization is not found in the search form, proceed with the remaining steps on this page.          It\u0026rsquo;s possible your organization is already registered as a publisher, as is often the case for museums and universities that maintain multiple natural history collections. If you determine that your organization is already registered as a publisher, reach out to the contact(s) listed on your institution\u0026rsquo;s publisher page to have them add your collection added as a separate dataset. For example, the ASU Biocollections are published to GBIF as a series of datasets.     If you have not already done so, familiarize yourself with the content on GBIF\u0026rsquo;s Become A Publisher page, which explains why the endorsement process is necessary.\n  Select \u0026ldquo;My organization is not already registered\u0026rdquo;, then review and agree to GBIF\u0026rsquo;s terms and conditions. Once you do so, a lengthier form will appear.\n  To complete the form:\nOrganizational Details:   Add your organizational details. This information may be somewhat similar to your collections profile in your Symbiota portal. However, if you are requesting endorsement for an organization that houses multiple collections that could potentially publish data to GBIF (now or in the future), this description should be more generalized. Refer to the description on the publisher page for the ASU Biocollections as an example. Use the map interface to create a placemark for your organization\u0026rsquo;s physical location.   Endorsing Node: If you are publishing your dataset through a Symbiota portal, select \u0026ldquo;Symbiota Support Hub\u0026rdquo; as your endorsing node.\n  GBIF Projects: For most collections in Symbiota portals, the answer is \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;. Answer \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; only if you are funded through a BID project.\n  Contacts: We strongly recommend adding multiple contacts for your organization and providing at least one generic institutional email address, if possible. This will minimize the chance that your organization\u0026rsquo;s publisher page will become orphaned due to staff turnover.\n  What and How:\n   For most collections in Symbiota portals, the answer is \u0026ldquo;Occurrence-only data\u0026rdquo;. This means specimen data. In Data Description, we suggest entering something like:   I intend to publish specimen occurrences through the Consortium of Southern Rocky Mountain Herbaria, which is a Symbiota portal, available from soroherbaria.org.\n  For the remaining three questions, most collections in Symbiota portals should select \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;.   Select \u0026ldquo;Register Organization\u0026rdquo;. At this point, if you selected the Symbiota Support Hub as your endorsing node, GBIF will notify the Hub that your organization has requested endorsement as a publisher.\n  Once approved, your organization will be listed as an \u0026ldquo;Endorsed Publisher\u0026rdquo; on the Support Hub\u0026rsquo;s Participant page on GBIF. When you open your new publisher page, note the publisher key that appears in the URL for the webpage; use this key when you go to publish your data to GBIF (Step 4).\n    ","tags":["aggregator","gbif","data publishing"],"section":"coll_manager"},{"date":"1639526400","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/checklist/conflict/","title":"Voucher Conflicts Tab","summary":"The Voucher Conflicts tab allows you to view a list of specimen vouchers for which their current identifications do not match how they were originally added as part of the checklist.

This can be done by your portal manager.\n  Use these instructions to set up an institutional account with GBIF so that there is a direct publishing agreement established between GBIF and the institution. Since the institutional account may be used to list multiple collection datasets associated with that institution (e.g. https://www.gbif.org/publisher/4c0e9f60-c489-11d8-bf60-b8a03c50a862 ), you should coordinate with other collections within your institution, if applicable. Note that the institutional datasets can be published to GBIF using different publishing resources. For instance, the zoological collections could import their data from VertNet IPT (http://ipt.vertnet.org) or their institutional IPT, vascular plant data from the SEINet https://swbiodiversity.org, and lichens from CNALH (https://lichenportal.org).  If you are sure your institution is not yet registered, complete the registration form and follow the instructions provided by GBIF. If your institution is already registered, review the GBIF metadata for your organization and existing datasets and contact GBIF to make any necessary changes. Be sure that none of the existing datasets contain the same data you are trying to publish. If they do, make the appropriate arrangements with GBIF so that the old dataset can be archived BEFORE re-publishing the new dataset.   Login to your Symbiota portal, go to your Administrator Control Panel (via My Profile =\u0026gt; Specimen Management tab =\u0026gt; click your collection name), and click on \u0026ldquo;Edit Metadata and Contact Information\u0026rdquo; link in the Administration Control Panel.

For more details, see Darwin Core definition. Rights Holder - The organization or person managing or owning the rights of the resource. For more details, see Darwin Core definition. Access Rights - Information or a URL link to page with details explaining how one can use the data. See Darwin Core definition. Dataset Type - Preserved Specimens signify a collection type that contains physical samples that are available for inspection by researchers and taxonomic experts. Use Observations when the record is not based on a physical specimen. Personal Observation Management is a dataset where registered users can independently manage their own subset of records. Records entered into this dataset are explicitly linked to the user\u0026rsquo;s profile and can only be edited by them. This type of collection is typically used by field researchers to manage their collection data and print labels prior to depositing the physical material within a collection. Even though personal collections are represented by a physical sample, they are classified as \u0026ldquo;observations\u0026rdquo; until the physical material is publicly available within a collection. Management Type - Use Snapshot when there is a separate in-house database maintained in the collection and the dataset within the Symbiota portal is only a periodically updated snapshot of the central database. A Live dataset is when the data is managed directly within the portal and the central database is the portal data. Global Unique Identifier (GUID) Source - Occurrence Id is generally used for Snapshot datasets when a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) field is supplied by the source database (e.g. Specify database) and the GUID is mapped to the occurrenceIdfield. The use of the Occurrence Id as the GUID is not recommended for live datasets. Catalog Number can be used when the value within the catalog number field is globally unique. The Symbiota Generated GUID (UUID) option will trigger the Symbiota data portal to automatically generate UUID GUIDs for each record. This option is recommended for many for Live Datasets but not allowed for Snapshot collections that are managed in local management system. iDigBio\u0026rsquo;s GUID Guide can be found here.

Enter a 1 in this column for all specimens for which you wish to redact data. Use the Skeletal File Uploader to upload this spreadsheet into the portal, mapping the new column to localitysecurity.\nGlobally redacting locality data for certain taxa Locality data and images can be redacted for all occurrences by a specific taxon by someone with superadministrator or taxon editor permissions. To do this, find the species in the Taxonomic Tree Viewer or Taxonomy Explorer and open the editor (either by clicking on the taxon name or clicking the pencil next to the name). Change the Locality Security field to \u0026ldquo;hide locality data\u0026rdquo;.\nThis will hide locality data for all occurrences of that taxon throughout the portal. Collections can opt out of this option by individually unchecking the Locality Security box or contacting their portal administrator for batch changes.\nRedacting data by state Finally, locality data and images can be redacted for occurrences of a given taxon that were collected in a certain state by managing a \u0026ldquo;Rare, threatened, protected species list\u0026rdquo;. A rare species administrator can create a species list specifically for managing sensitive species and then assign editing rights to one to several appropriate users for populating and managing the state list. The addition of a species to the list will automatically protect locality details of all specimens collected within the designated state. While localities details are protected from general users, collection managers and selected approved users will still be able to access the all locality information, map specimen records, and view label images.\nInstructions for creating state-based redacted species lists  Create a new empty rare species checklist.  Click “My Profile”, select the Species Checklists tab, and click the green plus sign. Change the Checklist Type to “Rare, threatened, protected species list”. If you don’t see the Checklist Type field located below the author field, then you probably do not have the necessary Rare Species Administration rights. In this case, you can continue creating the checklist and ask a portal administrator to change the checklist type at a later date. Enter the state name in the locality field. Do not abbreviate or add any other text other than the state name. The checklist can be private or public and made available to the general public   Add one to several editors  From the new checklists, click on the checklist administration editing pencil located towards the user right of the page Checklist editors do not need Rare Species Administration or any other special editing rights to manage the list   Checklist editors add species needing protection using the normal checklist editing tools.

Some portal communities actively curate their taxonomic thesaurus, while others use it largely as a curational tool and update it sparingly. Users interested in helping to curate the taxonomic thesaurus of a portal should contact the portal manager or help@symbiota.org.\nThe taxonomic thesaurus can be edited by superadministrators and users with express Taxonomy Editor permissions (see the User Permissions page for more information).\nMultiple thesauri Some portals include several backbone thesauri in case of, e.g., conflicting taxonomic concepts or authorities. One thesaurus will be displayed by default, but users can select between thesauri when using the checklist or list-viewing functions.\n","tags":["thesaurus","scientific names","taxonomy"],"section":"user"},{"date":"1657584000","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/permissions/","title":"User Permissions","summary":"This page describes the possible levels of user permissions that can be granted for a given Symbiota portal.\n Once a user has created an account in a Symbiota portal, they can be granted permissions for one or many collections in that portal.

A Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) is a data standard that is commonly used to package species occurrence data into a single, self-contained dataset. A DwC-A includes metadata, a file of occurrence data, and, often, files for determinations (identifications) and images. IPT Resource / Darwin Core Archive Provider: Use this upload type if you will provide a URL to an existing Darwin Core Archive published on the web, such as one provided through an IPT. File Upload: Use this upload type if you will provide a comma-separated value (CSV) or tab-separated value (TSV) file containing ALL fields of your occurrence data. You can convert an Excel document into a CSV file by clicking Save As, then selecting comma-delimited (CSV) from the file types. Note that, if data exists in the portal for any of the occurrences you are uploading, those data will be overwritten by the incoming data. To upload partial records, use a Skeletal File Upload. Skeletal File Upload: Use this upload type if you will provide a CSV or TSV file containing data from only a few fields (e.g., georeferences or other ancillary data). Note that any data provided in a skeletal file upload will NOT overwrite existing data in the database, so any pre-existing data in the desired fields must be deleted if you wish to replace it with the data from the skeletal file. NfN File Upload: Use this upload type if you will provide a CSV file produced from Notes from Nature. Direct Database Mapping: Stored Procedure: Use this option if you are transferring from a source schema to a Symbiota database located on the same MySQL database server. Script Upload: Use this option if you are transferring from a MySQL source to Symbiota database that is located on a different server.    Follow the directions below according to the Upload Type you have selected.\n  Darwin Core Archive Manual Upload Contribute to this section!\nIPT Resource / Darwin Core Archive Provider Contribute to this section!\nFile Upload or Skeletal File Upload  If you or your portal manager have created a Stored Procedure with data cleaning or other checks, enter the name of the stored procedure in the provided field. Otherwise, ignore this step. Click the Create Profile button. On the next page, you will see a list of existing upload profiles. Select the profile that you wish to use (the one you just greated) and click Initialize Upload.  To edit your upload profile in the future, you can click the pencil icon on this page.   Click the Choose File button and navigate to the file that you wish to upload in your File Manager or Finder window. Select that file and click Open. Click the Analyze File button. If the collection to which you are uploading data is live managed (the portal is your database system), proceed to step 7. If the collection to which you are uploading data is a “snapshot” of a specimen database managed within the home institution, select the primary key for the source specimen record from the dropdown menu. The primary key is a required field for snapshot datasets that will serve as the primary record identifier (the permanent link between the source database and the portal records). This field must be populated for every record with unique values. These values must also be stable and not changed in the central database over time. Snapshots will typically use the catalog number (accession number), barcode, or database primary key from the source database specimen table for this field. You will then see a page that will look similar to the one shown below. The length and contents of the Source Field/Target Field table will depend on what columns were included in the original CSV file.  Select which fields in your CSV file (Source Fields) will correspond to which fields in the Symbiota portal (Target Fields). Check the Symbiota Data Field Guide for definitions of each data field. Also see the Uploading Tips section below. Once you are satisfied with your field-to-field mapping (see next Notes), click the “Save Mapping” button. Select whether you would like the script to match the data in your file to existing data in the portal based on Catalog Number or Other Catalog Numbers. You will only need to do this if you are adding data to records that already exist in the portal. Otherwise, leave these unchecked. Select the Processing Status that you would like to apply to all your uploaded records (if desired) by selecting an option from the dropdown menu. Click the Start Upload button. This will upload your data into a temporary table so you can review it before committing the final upload. Verify that the correct number of records are being updated and/or added by viewing the Pending Data Transport Report on the next page.  View the data that have been stored in the temporary table to ensure correct mapping and formatting of the fields you are uploading. You can either:  Click the small box icon to the right of \u0026ldquo;Records to be updated\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;New records\u0026rdquo; to view the records in a table in your browser. Click the multiple file icon to the right of the box icon to download a CSV file of the records to be updated or new records.   If anything is incorrect, fix your CSV file and re-upload it according to the steps you followed above, or return to your field mapping and fix the field mapping. If everything looks good, click the Transfer Records to Central Specimen Table button. Note that this step is final and is not possible to undo!  Stored Procedure  Write a stored procedure used to transfer records (the collection cleanup scripts can be put in central stored procedure or kept separate) Set up the script to run as a regular cronjob.  Script Upload  Write a stored procedure used to transfer records. A sample Linux script is located here: SampleSystemUpload.sh. The cleanup scripts can be put in central stored procedure or kept separate. Set up the script to run as a regular cronjob.  Uploading Tips A list of fields that can be imported into a Symbiota data portal can be found here.\n  To take advantage of the Tag Name + Identifier system (in which you can tag an identifier/other catalog number with a specific title), enter the tag name followed by a colon and then the identifier value, e.g., \u0026ldquo;Old Accession Number: 12345\u0026rdquo;. For multiple identifiers, separate the tag name + identifiers by semicolons, e.g., \u0026ldquo;NP #: 4321; Accession #: 9876\u0026rdquo; If the scientific names in your CSV file include taxonomic authorship (e.g., Acer circinatum Pursh), map this field to the Target Field “scientificname.” If the scientific names included in your CSV file do NOT include taxonomic authorship (e.g., Acer circinatum), map this field to “sciname.” Collection dates mapped to eventDate will be evaluated and validated. Illegal dates will be placed in the verbatimEventDate field. The majority of the standard date formats are accepted, including Gregorian dates and Excel numeric date format (US only). eventDate will be generated from separate year,month, and day field values. If month or day fields are left null, ’00’ values will be used (ex: 1954-03-00, 1965-00-00). Month field values can be numeric or text (English or Spanish). Scripts attempt to extract valid date values from verbatimEventDate field when the eventDate field is null. Values of ’00’ are used for missing month or day (ex: 1954-03-00, 1965-00-00) If your elevation field is not consistently in meters, map it to the verbatimElevation field. Elevations in feet will be converted to meters as long as the units are specified in the field. Coordinate values:  Upon upload, background scripts will attempt to extract lat/long coordinate values from the verbatimCoordinates field. The field is evaluated for DMS and UTM formats, which are converted to decimal latitude and longitude. If you have lat/long in a single field, you can map this field to verbatimCoordinates, and decimal latitude and longitude fields will be automatically parsed. If you have UTM coordinates in multiple fields, map the fields (northing, easting, zone) to their matching UTM fields (utmnorthing, utmeasting, utmzone). This will instigate conversion of UTM coordinates to decimal latitude and longitude. The values will additionally be stored in the verbatiumCoordinates field. If you have UTM coordinates in a single field, map this field to utmnorthing and leave other UTM fields null in order to direct scripts to parse using only the UTM parser. TRS coordinates (Public Lands Survey System) can be entered as a single field into verbatimCoordinates, or into separate fields (trstownship, trsrange, trssection, trssectiondetails); however, these coordinates will not be automatically converted into decimal degrees due to potential differences in interpretation. See the georeferencing section of this guide (coming soon) for information about converting TRS coordinates to decimal degrees.

Use of leading zeros is recommended to enable correct sorting in the Symbiota interface.\nTag Name / Additional Identifier Values (= Other Catalog Numbers) Because specimens may be associated with multiple catalog numbers / identifiers, Symbiota portals have a tool that allows multiple values for Other Catalog Number. In the Occurrence Editor, this tool is located to the right of the Catalog Number field, and it includes boxes for \u0026ldquo;Tag Names\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Additional Identifier Values\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Tag Name field is an optional field that can be used to label the type of identifier being applied to the specimen. Tag Names are generally collection-specific (i.e., there are no recommended values). Common tags may include: Previous Catalog Number, Old Catalog #, Accession Number, NPS #, NPS Accession #, Secondary OccurrenceID, etc. The Tag Name field can be left blank if you do not wish to label the type of Other Catalog Number / Identifier.\nThe Additional Identifier Value field is where you can enter the alphanumeric value of the Other Catalog Number / Additional Identifier. For example, if you have an old accession number of 45678, you can enter \u0026ldquo;Accession #\u0026rdquo; in the Tag Name field, and 45678 into the Additional Identifier Value field. Alternatively, you can leave Tag Name blank and only enter a value into the Additional Identifier Value field.\nThese tools were released in March 2022 and are under active development. For this reason, some functionalities are still coming online. In particular, searching based on Other Catalog Numbers may produce incomplete results until all values of Other Catalog Number are transferred into the new Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system.\n How do I search for Other Catalog Numbers?    Values entered in the Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system are displayed in the Other Catalog Number field in the table display of a regular search. Because the Tag Name and Additional Identifier Value fields are separated, you can search for values of Other Catalog Number without having to include the tag name of the identifier. For example, if you search for Other Catalog Number \u0026ldquo;12345\u0026rdquo;, the results would include things like \u0026ldquo;Accession #: 12345\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;NPS #: 12345\u0026rdquo;. The search will be conducted based off of the number/value rather than the tag name.   What is the difference between the Other Catalog Number field and the Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system?    On the technical side, the Other Catalog Number field was a single text field, and the new Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value is a new table in the Symbiota schema (i.e., database structure). However, to a user, the function of these two systems are essentially the same. The Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system was created to facilitate smarter searching for values of Other Catalog Number. Values entered in the Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system are displayed in the Other Catalog Number field in the table display of a regular search. The Tag Name (if it exists) is listed first, followed by a colon, then the Additional Identifier Value (e.g., \u0026ldquo;NPS Accession #: 98765). If there are multiple identifiers, they are concatenated into the Other Catalog Number field and separated by semicolons (e.g., \u0026ldquo;NPS Accession #: 98765; Voucher Number: 12345).   How are Tag Names and Additional Identifier Values displayed in a search?    Values entered in the Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system are displayed in the Other Catalog Number field in the table display of a regular search. The Tag Name (if it exists) is listed first, followed by a colon, then the Additional Identifier Value (e.g., \u0026ldquo;NPS Accession #: 98765). If there are multiple identifiers, they are concatenated into the Other Catalog Number field and separated by semicolons (e.g., \u0026ldquo;NPS Accession #: 98765; Voucher Number: 12345).   How are Tag Names and Additional Identifier Values displayed in a data download?    Just like when you conduct a search on the Other Catalog Numbers field, values entered in the Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system are displayed in the Other Catalog Number field. The Tag Name (if it exists) is listed first, followed by a colon, then the Additional Identifier Value (e.g., \u0026ldquo;NPS Accession #: 98765). If there are multiple identifiers, they are concatenated into the Other Catalog Numbers field and separated by semicolons (e.g., \u0026ldquo;NPS Accession #: 98765; Voucher Number: 12345).

Scientific names can only be batch changed through the Batch Annotation tools or the Taxonomic Cleaning tools.  Exercise caution when using this tool. We also recommend downloading a copy of your database prior to making batch edits\n  There are two options for batch editing specimen records: you can change a value for the entire set of records in your collection or change a value for a selected set of records. To change all records, click on “Display Table” in the Record Search Form, then click the edit icon above the resulting table of all records from your collection. Continue to step 3. To change a value for a selected set of records, first search for the records of interest using the search form. Once you have the set of records to which you would like to make a batch edit, click on the edit icon at the top of your selected table of records. From the dropdown menu next to “Field Name” in Batch Update, select the field you want to edit. In “Current Value:” enter the text that is presently in the field you want to edit. In “New Value:” enter the text that you want to be in the edited field. Choose if you want to match the whole field or just match any part. Click “Batch Update Field” to enact your batch edit. A pop-up screen will tell you the number of records to be updated, warn you that the replace operation cannot be undone, and prompt you to OK the update. Proceed with caution and see examples below.  It is easy to inadvertently change text you did not intend to change. Generally, the more specific your “Current Value:” text, the less likely you are to run into unintended consequences. If possible, get an estimate from your record table of how many records should be affected, and check that against the number of records cited in the warning. If the numbers do not match, rethink your strategy.\nIt is not possible to check the record count when sorting by “Modified By” first. Doing so returns a count of the number of fields edited by the “Modified By” user for all records to be affected, rather than the number of records to be affected.\n Examples Example of a good use of batch edit: Standardizing plant collector names. If you are standardizing all Wherry’s collections to “Edgar T. Wherry,” then you could enter “E. T. Wherry” in Current Value and “Edgar T. Wherry” in New Value in batch edit for the collector field name, and update. Repeat for alternate forms of this name (e.g., “E T Wherry,” Edgar T Wherry”).\nExample of a bad use of batch edit: Changing cardinal directions. For example, if you entered “n.” in Current Value and “N” in New Value in batch edit for the locality in an attempt to change lower case abbreviated instances of the cardinal direction north, you would accomplish that, but you would also change any other character string with “n.” such as a sentence ending in the letter n. This would result in batch misplacements of “N” where “n.” should be. For example, “Next to the station. East side” would be transformed into “Next to the statioN East side.”\n","tags":["batch","edit","change","record search form"],"section":"coll_manager"},{"date":"1635310925","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/dev/","title":"Developer Guide","summary":"Learn to edit and develop Symbiota code","content":"Coming soon!\n","tags":[],"section":"dev"},{"date":"1635206400","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/edit/tabs/","title":"Record Editor Tabs","summary":"This page explains the tabs at the top of the Occurrence Editor tool.\n Upon opening the Record Editor page, you will see 4-5 tabs, depending on your level of permissions.

May be a global unique identifier or an identifier specific to the dataset.\nEx: https://opencontext.org/subjects/768A875F-E205-4D0B-DE55-BAB7598D0FD1\nSee Darwin Core's locationID Locality Security: Checking the Locality Security checkbox will hide locality details below the level of county from unauthorized users. This is typically done because the species is rare or threatened. Images are also hidden to protect locality details that might be viewable from the label. Users that are logged into the system and have the necessary permission to view locality details (e.g. collection managers) will continue to have access to all data. This box will automatically be checked if the species name is on any of the rare species lists (see sitemap). If one wishes to lock protection (on or off), click the Lock Security checkbox and/or enter a reason for security override in the text field. Leaving the locality security unlocked will allow default settings to be applied as determined by the sensitive species administrators, which is the recommendation for most records. For more information on sensitive species protection, see the page on Sensitive Species Protection. This field is not defined by the Darwin Core standard.\n Latitude and Longitude (decimal format):  The geographic latitude and longitude in decimal degrees. Latitudes from the southern hemisphere and longitudes in the western hemisphere (e.g. USA) should be entered as negative values. Click on the \u0026#34;Tools\u0026#34; button to enter the coordinates in the degree, minute, seconds (DMS) or the UTM formats. Decimal degrees are the preferred coordinate standard as defined by Darwin Core. See below for more information on using this tool.\nEx: 34.874022, -111.75774\nSee Darwin Core's decimalLatitude  Uncertainty (meters):  The accuracy of the georeference coordinates in meters (numeric value only). This is measured as the radius of a circle where the true point would be found if known. If coordinates are collected using a GPS, than the accuracy would be the error found within the GPS unit (usually around 10m). While previously collected specimens that have coordinates on the label recorded by the collector typically do not state the source of the coordinates (GPS, map, etc), it is typically a good assumption that the coordinates are accurate within one to two hundred meters. If the locality details are vague such as just \u0026#34;Grand Canyon\u0026#34;, then the coordinates should be the centroid within the uncertainty encompassing the greater area where the specimen may have been collected. If the locality is \u0026#34;Boynton Canyon, Sedona\u0026#34;, the uncertainty would be about 1500 m.
