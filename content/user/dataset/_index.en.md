{{< notice info >}} This page describes how to create lists of occurrences, called "datasets", in a Symbiota portal. {{</ notice >}}

A **dataset** is a list of occurrences created and/or curated by a user. Datasets may be used to keep track of specimens associated with certain inventory, research, data curation, or interest projects. For example, a researcher might save a datset consisting of all the occurrence records they used in a particular analysis, a collector might save a dataset consisting of all specimens from a particular collecting trip, or a collection manager might save a dataset of all the specimens that they need to physically inspect for curation purposes. Some examples in practice can be found [here](https://biorepo.neonscience.org/portal/collections/datasets/public.php?datasetid=163) and [here](https://biorepo.neonscience.org/portal/collections/datasets/public.php?datasetid=156).

Datasets can be private or publicly available.
